# Continuous LED Light Show Controller



## Overview

This project involves controlling a light show comprising six LEDs that continuously run through patterns. A function is implemented to manage this light show, triggered by a button with a pull-down resistor. Once activated, the function runs continuously until instructed to stop. A second button, connected to a pull-up resistor, triggers a hardware interrupt to halt the light show function.

## Functionality

- Controls a light show consisting of six LEDs running through various patterns.
- Activation of the light show function is initiated by pressing a button with a pull-down resistor.
- Deactivation of the light show function is achieved by pressing a button with a pull-up resistor, triggering a hardware interrupt.

## Implementation

Pressing the activation button triggers the light show function, causing the LEDs to run through their patterns continuously. Pressing the deactivation button halts the function via a hardware interrupt, stopping the light show.

## Components Used

- Six LEDs
- Activation button with pull-down resistor
- Deactivation button with pull-up resistor
- Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino)
